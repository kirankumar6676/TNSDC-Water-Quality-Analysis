# TNSDC-Water-Quality-Analysis

Water quality is the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of water based on standards of use. They are most often used in relation to a set of standards, compliance with which, as a rule, is achieved by water treatment, can be assessed. The most common standards used to monitor and assess water quality reflect the health of ecosystems, the safety of human contact, and the health of drinking water. Water quality has a significant impact on water supply and often determines supply options. Water quality parameters are determined by the intended use. Water quality work tends to focus on water that is treated for drinking water, industrial/domestic use, or restoration (environment/ecosystem, typically human health/aquatic life)
